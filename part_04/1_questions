Answer the following questions:

1) What is an array?
    A collection of variables of the same type, referred to by a common name
2) What the code required to create (instantiate) a String array with size 10 named "cats"?
    String [] cats = new String [10];

3) What is a multidimensional array?
    A list of one dimensional array

4) What is the code required to create (instantiate) a 2-dimensional int array that is 6 high and 6 wide named "scores"?
    int [][] scores = new int [6][6];

5) Using code, how do you retrieve a String that is the 10th item in a traditional array named dogs?
    String a = dogs[9];

6) What is an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException?
    An exception that is thrown when the index is less than zero or greater than or equal to the size of the array.

7) Using one line of code, demonstrate how to retrieve the second to the last item from a int array.
    int a = array[array.length - 2];

8) What is the maximum allowable size of an array in Java?
    As long as the int size

9) What is a bubble sort?
    A simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list to be sorted,
    compares each pair of adjacent items and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

10) How does a bubble sort work?
    Repeatedly steps through the list to be sorted, compares each pair of adjacent items and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

11) When might you use an irregular array? What is a good example of an irregular array?
    When one needs a very large multidimensional array that is sparsely populated. Counting number of passengers in a public transport.

12) Demonstrate how to iterate through an array, printing each value, using a for loop.
    int [] array = new int[10];
    int i;

    for (i = 0; i < 10; i++){
        array[i] = i;
        System.out.print(array[i] + " ");
    }
13) Demonstrate how to iterate through an array, printing each value, using a while loop.
    int i = 0;
    while (i < 10){
        System.out.println(array[i]);
        i++;
    }

14) What is a queue?
    A list in which elements can be accessed first-in, first-out order only

15) What are the two primary operations that a queue performs?
    put and get

16) What is a stack?
    A list in which elements can be accessed first-in, last-out order only

17) What differentiates stacks and queues?
    Stacks use first-in, last-out order, while queues use first-in, first-out order only

18) When would you use an enhanced for loop?
    When we need to iterate through the elements of an array.

19) What is "The Collections Framework"? What classes does it include?
    A set of classes and interfaces that implement commonly reusable collection data structures.
    Interface, Implementations, Algorithms

20) How do you iterate over a two-dimensional array? Demonstrate using psuedo code.
    for (int [] val : dataArray){
        for(int x : val){
        }

21) What is a String?
    A class in java that defines and supports character strings.

22) What are a few common methods for operating on Strings?
    length(); charAt();

23) What does "Strings are immutable" mean?
    Once created, the character sequence that makes up the string cannot be altered.

24) Using the CLI, how do you invoke a Java application and provide two parameters to the main method?
    java Class param1 param2
