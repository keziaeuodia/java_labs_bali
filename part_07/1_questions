4 How do packages affect access to Java classes?
    Adding extra layer to access control

5) What is an interface?
    Interface is a group of methods with no body, which can be implemented and defined by a class

6) What makes interfaces unique?
    Because a lot of classes can have the same methods, but applying different codes

7) What keyword is used to specify that a class is going to use a separate interface?

    more than 1

11) What is a default interface method?
