1) What is Java inheritance?
    A feature in java where classes can be derived from another class

2) How does inheritance work?
    The subclass inherits the variables and methods that the parentclass/superclass has subclass inherits all

3) What are some advantages that inheritance provides?
    The subclasses can have all the feature that the parent class has, so it minimize duplicate codes.

4) What does the "super" keyword do?
    Calling the parent class

5) In what order are constructors called when there are multiple subclasses?
    Super - Sub 1 - Sub 2

6) What does it mean when a method is overridden?
    Declaring a method in sub class which is already present in parent class

7) How do overridden methods support polymorphism?
    By having its own specific implementation in an inherited method without even modifying the parent class code

8) What is the difference between an overloaded method and an overridden method?
    Method is overloaded in the same class, overridden in different classes.

9) What is dynamic method dispatch?
    Dynamic method dispatch is the mechanism by which a call
    to an overridden method is resolved at run time, rather than compile time

10) What does the "final" keyword do?
    To specify variables which values are not to be changed

11) Are classes in Java are a subclass of what super class?
    Object
