1) What is the difference between a byte stream and a character stream?
    byte stream handles input and output of bytes
    character stream handles input and output of characters

2) List at least 3 examples of byte stream classes?
    FileInputStream, FileOutputStream, BufferedInputStream

3) List at least 3 examples of character stream classes?
    FileWriter, FileReader, BufferedReader

4) What is try-with-resources? Why is it super cool?
    A statement that automates the closing process of resources

5) Demonstrate a try-wth-resources block:


6) What does the read() method on the FileInputStream class return?
    int

7) What is the documentation above of the FileInputStream class header say? (hint: inside /** ... */)
    A FileInputStream obtains input bytes from a file in a file system.
    What files are available depends on the host environment.
    FileInputStream is meant for reading streams of raw bytes such as image data.
    For reading streams of characters, consider using FileReader.

8) Is a DataOutputStream used for bytes or characters?
    Bytes

9) What is a BufferedReader?
    BufferedReader class reads text from a character-input stream,
    buffering characters so as to provide for the efficient reading of characters, arrays, and lines.

10) Why does a BufferedReader require an InputStreamReader as an argument?
    To convert the byte input to character

11) What does the InputStreamReader do with it's byte stream argument?
    It reads bytes and decodes them into characters using a specified charset.

12) What is the difference between the read() and readLine() on BufferedReader?
    read() reads character by character, while readLine() is useful for bigger data that returns line by line

13) Demonstrate instantiating a BufferedReader that will read a file called "yucatan_cenotes.txt"
    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader("yucatan_cenotes.txt"))
